1. Handling Missing Values: Identifying and addressing missing data.
2. Data Normalization: Scaling data to a common range.
3. Data Transformation: Converting data types or formats.
4. Error Detection and Correction: Identifying and correcting errors.
5. Data Standardization: Ensuring consistency in data formats.
